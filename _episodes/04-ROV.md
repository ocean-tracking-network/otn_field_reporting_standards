## Record Keeping for Robotics Missions

Due to our obligation to funding agencies and partners, its essential that we document all ROV missions thoroughly. This should include the archiving of all collected data, video footage and other samples along with complete metadata to give temporal and geographical context to this archived data. 

While this has been done periodically in the past, its come time to re-evaluate the workflow and ensure all industry reporting standards are being met.

### Current OTN ROV Reporting Requirements

The instructions for ROV/SSS Reporting are available on the [Field Ops GitLab](https://gitlab.oceantrack.org/otnfield/OTN_Field_Ops/-/wikis/ROV%20and%20SSS%20Reporting).

1. When a request for an ROV project is received and scoped, a project needs to be entered into the [Loaner Operations project in Podio](https://podio.com/ocean-tracking-network-new/operations/apps/robotics-projects). This information will be used by the Project Management team to track the partnerships formed and any legal agreements required.
2. Once an ROV mission has been completed, the following information is added to [this OneDrive folder](https://dalu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/otndc_dal_ca/EnneuV4kB1hIlIIoeL1TbE0BAZH9OsCR--ClfC4u3SMffA?e=70KJFN). Direct uploading is necessary because the size of most of these files precludes them being emailed.
	- Data files from the instruments
	- Video files from the instruments
	- Any video clips that have been deemed relevant/interesting, or notes describing any significant video sections (for the Communications team).
	- GPS trackfile of the flightpath (if available), or start/end coordinates for the mission
3. Once an ROV mission has been completed, the following information is emailed to OTNDC@Dal.ca or posted in the relevant Data Portal folder.
	- [Mission report](https://members.oceantrack.org/data/data-collection/otn-mission-report.xls)
	- Deployment metadata **TODO: add template**

Projects completed for other partners will get their own project created in the OTN database, while all other OTN-lead projects will be added to an OTN-Robotics catch-call project.

### Current OTN SSS Reporting Requirements

The instructions for ROV/SSS Reporting have been available on the [Field Ops GitLab](https://gitlab.oceantrack.org/otnfield/OTN_Field_Ops/-/wikis/ROV%20and%20SSS%20Reporting).

1. When a request for a sidescan project is received and scoped, a project needs to be entered into the [Loaner Operations project in Podio](https://podio.com/ocean-tracking-network-new/operations/apps/robotics-projects). This information will be used by the Project Management team to track the partnerships formed and any legal agreements required.
2. Once a sidescan mission has been completed, the following information is added to [this OneDrive folder](https://dalu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/otndc_dal_ca/EnneuV4kB1hIlIIoeL1TbE0BAZH9OsCR--ClfC4u3SMffA?e=70KJFN)
	- Raw data files from the instrument
	- GPS trackfile of the flightpath
	- any processed SSS files/images
3. Once a SSS mission has been completed, the following information is emailed to OTNDC@Dal.ca (or posted in the relevant Data Portal folder)
	- [Mission report](https://members.oceantrack.org/data/data-collection/otn-mission-report.xls)
	- Deployment metadata **TODO: add template**

Projects completed for other partners will get their own project created in the OTN database, while all other OTN-lead projects will be added to an OTN-Robotics catch-call project.

## Establishing Standards Based on Industry

OTNDC's questions for the field team include:

- What are the standard data files that are collected by ROV or SSS missions?
- What extra information is generally important for data analysis of these files? Instrument programming, weather conditions, oceanographic information?
- What do most professionals use for geographic context to missions? GPS trackfile, start/end coordinates?
- Are there standard reporting templates we can adopt?

We are excited to expand our robotics fleet and are keen and willing to change our expectations based on the experience of professionals.
