## Requirements------

### R version: 3.6.x or newer (recommend 4.0.x) and RStudio.

# Once R/RStudio is installed: open RStudio and run this install script. Please run it line-by-line instead of all at once in case there are errors.

#Note: When running through the installs, you may encounter a prompt asking you to upgrade dependent packages.
      #Choosing Option `3: None`, works in most situations and will prevent upgrades of packages you weren't explicitly looking to upgrade.
